      <h2>
        Why do we value the objects we value? </h2>
      <p>Objects and Power examines the systems surrounding collections, investigating how history is told through the
        acquisition, presentation, and interpretation of art, artifacts, and texts. The ten artists in the exhibition
        address varied topics that speak to how objects relate to power, such as the roots of collecting and museums;
        instances of extraction, theft, and erasure; themes of Indigeneity, access, and ownership; and examples of
        artists and community groups telling stories and imbuing power to objects on their own terms. Museums,
        libraries, and archives are repositories of objects and information that tell narratives about human history.
        While these organizations carry a weight of authority regarding art, artifacts, and documents, institutions are
        not neutral; connections to wealth, conquest, and extraction are woven throughout their holdings and
        infrastructure. While many institutions are doing work to confront the complicated provenance within their
        collections, Objects and Power features contemporary artists who consider these problems in their work—either
        directly or by circumvention. Be it through unpacking and critiquing power structures or through material
        directly carrying power in resistance, Objects and Power connects the dots between the objects we care about and
        the “work” these objects are doing. </p>
